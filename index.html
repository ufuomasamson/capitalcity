                    <p><strong>I've been offering peace of mind to Arizona families since 1985.</strong></p>
                    <p>I graduated from ASU's Sandra Day O'Connor law school in Tempe Arizona in 1985 and have practiced in the East Valley - Mesa, Apache Junction, Queen Creek, Gilbert and now Scottsdale - ever since. I also have an office on the West side, in Surprise. I spent decades in courtrooms, helping people with financial difficulties, and in 2010 began my transition into estate planning. Now, I help my clients stay out of legal trouble and give their loved ones a precious gift: An estate plan that will keep their affairs out of court.</p>
                    <p><strong>NEW!</strong> I offer complete estate plans from start to finish, including signing, remotely, so you won't have to leave home to check this off your to-do list!</p>

            <p>Most people need at least a simple will to clear up any potential disputes and let everyone know how they want their property to be distributed. But to avoid probate, additional steps are needed, such as Beneficiary designations on real estate and financial accounts..</p>
            <p>Virtually everyone should also have a Power of Attorney for Health Care - including Mental Health - and another POA for financial matters. You don't know when you may need someone to take care of business for you, or make important medical decision for you because you cannot. A Power of Attorney is where you identify your agent who can speak for you and make decisions if you are unable to..</p>
            <p>The Living Will is a place to tell the world "I don't want to be kept alive artificially by a machine. If I have no brain activity or quality of life, let me go!"</p>

            <p>This private document lets you be as creative as you like with the management of your affairs. It essentially becomes a court order when you pass away, so the people you choose can take care of all of your property without the hassle of a probate proceeding.</p>

                            <p>It depends. If you have one heir and everything goes to that person, you may not need a Trust. But you will need a Will, and if you have a home, you will need deed work done because a Will alone does not keep your family out of court..</p>

                        <button class="faq-question">How is a Trust different from a Will?</button>
                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>The Will and the Trust can do the same thing: describe how you want your property to be handled when you pass away. They both require additional steps to implement, such as deed work or beneficiary designations on accounts.</p>
                            <p>The biggest difference is flexibility. A Trust gives you an opportunity to provide for all kinds of contingencies - like what happens if your son passes away before you do? Do you want your grandchildren to receive his share when they are 18? Or, should it be held in Trust until they are old enough to be responsible with it? what about spouses? Maybe you want funds to be available to those grandchildren for college and medical care, but not for a trip across country. You set the rules in a Trust. If all you have is a Will, you don't have those kinds of options.</p>

                            <p>Take a test drive at no risk or expense. My first meeting with you is free of charge, and I can do it in person, by phone or as a video chat. There is no obligation. I will quote you a flat fee, with options, and I will stand by it. You don't get that very often from an attorney with decades of experience!</p>
