Header: Who I am



Paragraph text:

I was born and raised in Southern California. I had a paper route and later worked in grocery stores, including on the night crew.



I married my sweetheart, Katherine, a Phoenix girl, in 1979 and we are still going strong. We have five living children and twelve grandchildren. Life is good.



I decided to go to law school in 1981, after trying several different fields and college majors. It was the right decision. I have enjoyed helping people with financial and legal needs since getting my license in 1985. My current practice allows me to meet needs of my clients and offer them peace of mind, without having to go to court. I am proud to say I have created estate plans for thousands of clients since 2010 and helped them save their loved ones from the hassle and expense of probate proceedings.
